AI ML Internship Assignment 1


Project Overview:
          This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features such as make, model, year, engine size, horsepower, and MPG, which are used to train and evaluate a regression model for predicting car prices.This car price prediction project aims to predict car prices using features such as make, model, year, engine size, horsepower, and MPG. The project covers key machine learning concepts including features, labels, overfitting, underfitting, and regularization. It involves installing necessary dependencies, preprocessing the data, and splitting it into training and test sets. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set, with hyperparameter tuning and validation to improve performance. Overall, this project provides a practical introduction to machine learning, enhancing understanding through a real-world application.
